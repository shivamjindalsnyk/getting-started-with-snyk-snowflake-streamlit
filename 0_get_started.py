            This is a demo of the Snowflake<>Snyk integration with a few varying levels of complexity.
             Each of the pages above will hopefully show you something new about working with streamlit.
             Feel free to take any of the code snippets and use them in your own projects. \n\n This first page
             is focused just on getting the data from Snowflake and showing a simple representation of the data.
             \n\n With each of these, the code is to serve as starter code. There may be bugs, there may be issues but 
             hopefully it can help you get started with getting value out of Snyk's Snowflake integration quickly :)
